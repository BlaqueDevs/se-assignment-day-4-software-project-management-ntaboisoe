# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
This is important to avoid cost overruns while also ensuring clients’ objectives are met especially for time sensitive projects. Project managers need to ensure constant communication with the project owner in terms of the status of current project and also work with the developers using agile methods to avoid delays,

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
It ensures that there are available funds to fully implement a project. A weekly chart showing utilization and remaining funding ensures that project owners and managers have visibility of the projected run rate thus ensuring budget is within target limit.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is best for solving dev projects that do not have clear outlines and its very versatile. Waterfall is suitable for well-structured projects. 

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile might be more beneficial for short but quick projects while Waterfall are usually for projects that will take a long time.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Continuous integration and continuous improvement methods while also using agile methods and version control ensure high code quality. Doing all these will reduce costs of fixing bugs and incidences of downtime.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining project scope ensures that everyday each member of the team is working towards those goals thus ensuring project is finished on time and budget.
A Work Breakdown Structure is the decomposition of the total work required to complete a project and then breaking these down into smaller more manageable “work packages”.


## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
A project schedule ensures that timelines for completion of tasks are clearly outlined. A Gantt chart allows for visualization of this timeline clearly showing when overdue and upcoming tasks.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Some software end up being developed to address a problem that is different from the actual problem faced by the users.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
By using a demo

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Simplicity while solving the user problem with ease and friendly navigation.


## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
NA

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?

It helps to identify the niche market and price point for the app.
